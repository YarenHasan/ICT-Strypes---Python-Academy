QUESTION:
Produce a CTE that can return the upward recommendation chain for any member. 
You should be able to select recommender from recommenders where member=x. 
Demonstrate it by getting the chains for members 12 and 22. 
Results table should have member and recommender, ordered by member ascending, recommender descending.



ANSWER:
WITH RECURSIVE recommenders AS (
  SELECT 
    memid AS member,
    recommendedby AS recommender
  FROM cd.members
  WHERE memid IN (12, 22)

  UNION ALL

  SELECT
    r.member,
    m.recommendedby
  FROM recommenders r
  JOIN cd.members m ON r.recommender = m.memid
  WHERE m.recommendedby IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  r.member,
  r.recommender,
  m.firstname,
  m.surname
FROM recommenders r
JOIN cd.members m ON r.recommender = m.memid
ORDER BY r.member ASC, r.recommender DESC;
