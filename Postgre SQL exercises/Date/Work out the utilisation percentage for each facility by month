QUESTION:
Work out the utilisation percentage for each facility by month, sorted by name and month, rounded to 1 decimal place.
Opening time is 8am, closing time is 8.30pm. 
You can treat every month as a full month, regardless of if there were some dates the club was not open.


ANSWER:
WITH booking_slots AS (
  SELECT 
    facid,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', starttime) AS month,
    SUM(slots) AS total_slots
  FROM cd.bookings
  GROUP BY facid, DATE_TRUNC('month', starttime)
),
days_in_month AS (
  SELECT 
    facid,
    month,
    total_slots,
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM (month + INTERVAL '1 month - 1 day')) AS days
  FROM booking_slots
),
utilisation AS (
  SELECT 
    f.name,
    d.month,
    ROUND((d.total_slots::numeric / (d.days * 25)) * 100, 1) AS utilisation
  FROM days_in_month d
  JOIN cd.facilities f ON f.facid = d.facid
)
SELECT *
FROM utilisation
ORDER BY name, month;
