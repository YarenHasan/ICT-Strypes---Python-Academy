# üÉè Blackjack Game (Console-Based Python)
This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Blackjack game, also known as 21, built using Python. It features object-oriented design with classes for Card, Deck, Hand, and Chips, and includes core gameplay mechanics like betting, hit/stand choices, Ace adjustment, and win/loss scenarios.
<br />

üéÆ How to Play:

  * Each player starts with two cards and aims to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
  * The Dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or more.
  * Aces can count as either 11 or 1, depending on the best advantage.
  * You start with 100 chips and can place a bet each round.
  * Player decides to hit (h) or stand (s).
  * After each round, you‚Äôre asked if you'd like to play again.
<br />

üß† Game Rules Summary:

 * Number cards are worth their face value.
 * Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
 * Ace is worth 11, but adjusts to 1 if you bust.
<br />
