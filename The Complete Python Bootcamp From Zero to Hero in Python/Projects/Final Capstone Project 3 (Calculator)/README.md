# FINAL CAPSTONE PROJECT 3
 # 🧮 Simple Arithmetic Calculator
This is a basic 🐍 Python command-line calculator that performs simple math operations (+, -, *, /) on two numbers you enter. It’s quick, interactive, and beginner-friendly! 🎉
<br />

✨ Features:

  * ➕ Addition, ➖ Subtraction, ✖️ Multiplication, ➗ Division

  * 👤 User input via terminal

  * 🖨️ Nicely formatted output like a op b = result
<br />

⚠️ Notes:

  * ❗ If you enter an invalid operator, you'll get a warning to restart and try again.

  * 🛑 No check for division by zero — this will cause a crash (ZeroDivisionError). Consider improving error handling!

  * 👶 Great for beginners learning input, conditionals, and string formatting.
<br />

💡 Example:

    Please type the first number: 8
    Please type the second number: 2
    What kind of operation would you like to do?
    Choose between "+, -, *, /" : /
    8 / 2 = 4.0
