# MILESTONE PROJECT 1
# Tic Tac Toe Game (Console-Based)
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in Python. The game allows two players to take turns placing their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 board, with the objective of getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

Features:

	Two-player game mode (local multiplayer).
	Console-based board display using a number pad layout.
	Random player starter.
	Input validation to prevent invalid or occupied positions.
	Option to replay the game after each round.



How to Play:

	Run the script in a Python environment that supports IPython.display.clear_output().
	Player 1 chooses a marker (X or O), and Player 2 gets the remaining marker.
	Players take turns choosing positions on the board (1â€“9, like a number pad).
	The game announces a winner or a tie once the board is full or a winning condition is met.
	After the game ends, players are prompted whether they want to play again.



Board Layout Reference:

	The board positions correspond to the number pad as follows:
	 7 | 8 | 9
	-----------
 	 4 | 5 | 6
	-----------
 	 1 | 2 | 3
